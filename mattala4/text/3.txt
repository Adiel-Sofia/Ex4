Don't know when my nights became so complicated
Can't recall my mornings ever being this faded
Maybe this is karma, definition of jaded, oh
This stays on my mind, this stays on my mind
Tryna put a muzzle on my crazy feelings
One minute I'm cool and then the next, I'm tripping, no
With somebody new, I swear she don't deserve this
We're still on my mind, she's still on my mind
