Somebody once told me

All the single ladies, all the single ladies
All the single ladies, all the single ladies

Don't know when my nights became so complicated
Can't recall my mornings ever being this faded
Maybe this is karma, definition of jaded, oh

My grandpa fought in World War II
He was such a noble dude
I can't even finish school
Missed my mom and left too soon

Kissy face, kissy face
Sent to your phone, but
I'm tryna kiss your lips for real (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Red hearts, red hearts
That's what I'm on, yeah

We were on fire
I slashed your tires
It's like we burn so bright, we burn out
I made you chase me
I wasn't that friendly
My love, my drug, we're fucked up, oh

Excuse me
You look like you love me
You look like you want me
To want you to come on home
And baby, I don't blame you
For lookin' me up and down across this room
I'm drunk and I'm ready to leave

I didn't mean to end his life, I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night, can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight, 'fore I end up behind bars
What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry

They might say "hi" and I might say "hey"
But you shouldn't worry about what they say
'Cause they got nothing on you, baby (yeah)
Nothing on you, baby (not-not-not-nothing on you, babe)
(Not-nothing on you)

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
